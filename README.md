Welcome to My SQL Projects: New Wheels Project

The "New Wheels Project" is a comprehensive SQL and Excel analysis focusing on a vehicle company's performance through detailed examination of customer ratings, purchasing history, revenue, shipment times, and customer feedback data. The primary goal of this project was to identify the company's strengths and weaknesses, thereby providing actionable recommendations for improvement.

The analysis revealed a strong customer preference for Chevrolet vehicles, which emerged as the most favored brand among the company's offerings. This insight indicates a potential area of growth if the company were to increase its Chevrolet inventory, potentially attracting more customers and boosting overall sales.

However, the project also uncovered a concerning trend: customer ratings and order volumes showed a declining pattern from quarter 1 to quarter 4. A deeper dive into the data revealed a positive correlation between these declining metrics and the increase in shipment times over the same period. Specifically, shipment delays and a rising number of days required to deliver vehicles to customers were identified as potential factors contributing to the drop in customer satisfaction and order frequency.

To address these issues, it is recommended that the company streamline its logistics and shipment processes, aiming to reduce delivery times and improve overall customer experience. Additionally, focusing on expanding the Chevrolet vehicle lineup could capitalize on existing customer preferences, driving sales and enhancing brand loyalty.

In conclusion, the "New Wheels Project" provided valuable insights into the company's operational challenges and market opportunities. By implementing the recommended strategies, the company can improve its performance, better meet customer expectations, and secure a competitive edge in the market.
